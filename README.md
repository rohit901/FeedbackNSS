# Anonymous Feedback Application

This app was developed for NSS, BITS Pilani. 
The app allowed NSS volunteers to give feedback of their respective department seniors in a completely **anonymized** way. 
The app notifies the user when a new feedback is received, allows users to view all their feedbacks, mark them as resolved, and give feedback to other departments.
